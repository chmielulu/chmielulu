### Some of my projects that can not be open
- [Gorsk.pl](https://gorsk.pl/) (Gatsby, TypeScript) 

*Effects in Three.JS come from [this repository](https://github.com/Aqro/gooey-hover-codrops). I removed the unnecessary things and rewrote it to the new GSAP API, Typescript, React refs*
- [Villa Kwiatowa](https://villakwiatowa.rendpro.com/) (Gatsby, JavaScript)
- [Rend Pro](https://rendpro.com/) (Gatsby, JavaScript)

All 3D visualizations from `gorsk.pl` were created by my friend [Aleksander Gadomski](https://aleksandergadomski.pl)
